# 🧱 Minecraft World Save Tracker

Welcome to my Minecraft world save repository!  
Each commit in this repo represents a different save state of my Minecraft world, allowing you to track the progression and evolution of my builds, adventures, and exploration over time.

## 📂 What’s Inside

This repository contains my Minecraft `saves` folder, specifically focused on a single world (or multiple, if applicable). Each update reflects new gameplay progress, including:

- Building updates 🏗️  
- Resource gathering 🌲⛏️  
- Redstone contraptions ⚡  
- Exploration and discoveries 🗺️  
- Survival achievements 🛡️  

## 🔄 Commit History as Timeline

Every commit in this repo is a snapshot of the world at a specific point in time.  
Feel free to browse the commit history to "rewind" or "fast-forward" through the development of the world.

- Want to see how a structure evolved?  
  → Check out the commits!
- Curious what progress was made in a single play session?  
  → Each commit = one save state.
